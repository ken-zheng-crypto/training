Question 1: If the API returns the temperature in a decimal form (like 27.5 C), how to submit this decimal number to the smart contract while keeping its precision?


     1、 We can multiply the temperature by 10, report to the smart contract, 

     2、 When we read the temperature from the smart contract,  divide by 10



Question 2: How to store a negative temperature while keeping the current smart contract interface unchanged?

   
   Bit operations, two’s complement representation of the number



Question 3: During the "Step 3" in the task, it will take 3 JSON-RPC calls to read weather info for 3 cities from smart contract. 
Is it possbile to reduce that to only one request to get all the data back? (Hint: Google search "makerdao multicall")

   
   use makerdao multicall  aggregate, 
   
   1、use remix deploy multicall contract : training/assignment2/contracts/Multicall.sol

   2、use @makerdao/multical.js  aggregate call, script : training/assignment2/scripts/readWeatherMulticall.js
